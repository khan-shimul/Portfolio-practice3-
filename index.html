            <h3>Crazy Gamer | Lazy Programmer</h3>
            <p>You know that i want to be a programmer and the life of a programmer is quite dense â€“ most programmers
                spend much of their time writing code using the computer language and thinking on how to solve problems
                such as testing and solving for bugs in the code or thinking of how to create a new feature. It doesn't
                mean at all that other jobs are serene.</p>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>I want to be a developer better than Jhankar Mahbub Bhai. I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can
                build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma how
                to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>
